# What is the phaser-discord community?

Just a bunch of folks who like experiment with gamedev. Mostly we're working
on [Phaser][ph] projects.

[You're invited][inv], we're friendly! :smile:

Community rules are over in our [Code of Conduct][coc].

# How do I get started with GameDev / Phaser?

The short version is: build stuff, read things, ask questions.

We also have a [longer answer][q1] in the FAQ.

# FAQ

We started one! It's right next to this file: [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md).

Read it, make Pull Requests, be awesome.

# Community Repo

It seems a reasonable to ask "why does a discord community need a code repo?"

In part we have an answer in [administration#3][iss-3]. Generally though there
is a lot of energy and talent and our group. We've taught each other a lot and
helping people get through the first steps of Phaser is great... but having
a  collection of examples and tutorials that we can refer to and build on over
time would be great.

And, I mean, if we're going to put that much effort into them why lock them
away in Discord?
