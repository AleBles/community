**Tell me the story of Phaser v3 and Typescript**

_Last Updated: 2018-03-13_

[phaser#3324][ts-ticket] is the official Phaser tracking ticket. There are two
community-driven efforts to get typescript done before Rich. They are mentioned
in threads [#1][ts-forum-link] and [#2][ts-forum-link2] on the HTML5 game dev
forums. The first thread links to [a github project][ts-gh] and the second
includes a `.d.ts` download directly.
